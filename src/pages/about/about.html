            Freedom, fearlessness, intrepidity and the avant-garde spirit in the bone is intended to
            break the rigid old customs and
            regulations and flaunt new ideas, delineate self magnetic field through a gender-neutral
            style of dress, and with this,
            they gang up their friendgeneration. This is not a revolt, but a change.</p>
        <p class="text">

            When mainstream consciousness is no longer fully recognized by the fashionable society, the
            changing trend of thought is
            one after another in the field of clothing, clothing and footwear is no longer the still
            stuff of the cover of the body,
            but the rebirth of the soul.</p>
        <p class="text">

            There is a fundamental consensus that the gender boundaries of clothing and footwear are
            increasingly blurred, and it is
            this blurring that creates gaps of freedom. Based on convergence and consistency of this
            consensus, AGENDER is born at
            the right time.</p>
        <p class="text">

            AGENDER's concept of Gender Free is to break the gender label of clothing and deconstruction
            design the "unbounded
            clothing". There is no standard assigns that a man must wear a suit, a woman must wear a
            skirt, frankness and ease can
            cross the border, and shuttle freely between men and women, and pursue right equality in the
            name of clothing. It's not
            just the pursuit of ‘All men are created equally’, it's furthermore about detached feelings
            and finding a way to dress
            comfortably and pleasantly.</p>
        <p class="text">

            AGENDER encourages everyone to break through himself and embrace more possibilities beyond
            their borders.
        </p>
        <p class="text">

            AGENDER also believes that every human being is born different and does not have to
            construct his own spirit and flesh
            according to the worldly wishes, nor need to compete with the secular in a aggressive way,
            but to rebuild the roots of
            freedom silently in order to truly understand freedom. This is a state , and clothing is an
            indispensable carrier.
